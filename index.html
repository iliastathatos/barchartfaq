  <h3>What should I use this graph for?</h3>
 <p></p>
  The bar chart race format is ideal for visualising competition and evolvement throughout time. It is especially well-suited for presenting changes in rank, like in the case of basketball teams, political parties, companies or populations.</p>   
 <p><h3>I am not sure this is the chart I need to use; can you help?</h3>
 <p></p>
Of course! You can use our interactive visual vocabulary. Just choose the type of data you want to visualise and we will propose the most fitting type of graph, according to your needs.</p>
<p>
  <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
 <p></p>
A good way to get cracking is having a CSV or Excel file of your data. It can be easily uploaded to Flourish, or you can simply cut and paste.
Proper formatting of the file will make creating a Flourish bar chart race a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>
·Each participant in the “competition” should have their own row in the file, while the first column should host the participants' names.<br>
·The subsequent columns should contain any additional information or images (don’t fret, we’ll get to this in a bit!) you may want to use, followed by the time “points”, the laps in the competition, such as particular dates, weeks or years. A little something like this:<br>
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Day 1</th>
        <th>Day 2</th>
        <th>Day 3</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Lance Armstrong</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>7</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chris Hoyle</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>6</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
<br>
<b>Tip</b>: Still confused? You can always examine and play around with the data structure of our own example and familiarize yourself with it. Open our bar chart race, head over to the data tab and peek inside!

 <p><h3>My data is the wrong way round! What should I do?</h3>
 <p></p>
No worries, you can swap rows for columns very easily! In the data tab, on the top left-hand corner of your spreadsheet, left of the first column and above the first row, you can find a button that transposes your data.</p>

<p>
  <h3>My data is on Flourish, but the bar chart isn’t moving.</h3>
 <p></p>
  It will very soon! The way Flourish works, you must select which columns to visualise and draw information from, making it highly modular and intuitively reusable. Essentially you are pointing to Flourish what to plot.<br>
  <br>
Head over to your “Data” spreadsheet, and on the right, you can find the relevant menu. On the “Label” field you should specify the column that contains the names of the participants, while on the “Values” field you should insert all columns that contain values to be visualised. The optional categories field should point to a column containing a qualitative value that separates your data, for example the ethnicity of the top car manufacturers of the last 50 years. These can function as your interactive filters.<br>
<br>
<b>Tip</b>: Fiddle around with the columns to be visualised and discover what they do for yourself! It really helps in understanding how it all works.

 <p><h3>Can I enrich the bars with images?</h3>
 <p></p>
Absolutely! You can create a column with picture URLs that assigns images to each participant of the race. Then, insert this column's name in the “Image” field of the “Select Columns to Visualise” section on the right. Through the options you can even choose if the pictures should be appearing at the top or bottom of the bars.<br> Through the “Labels and Images” submenu in the preview section you can edit their size, position and many other options. For the time being, the source images have to be online. </p>

 <p><h3>Can I alter the speed? My bar chart race goes too fast/slow. I can’t keep up/I am bored!</h3>
 <p></p>
Yes, you can. Go to Preview and in the “Animation” submenu you can change the duration of the bar chart race  animation.</p>

<p>
  <h3>The counter is too big/small. How do I change this?</h3>
 <p></p>
  You can change the size of the counter through the “Labels and Images” submenu.</p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p><h3>Annotations would be quite helpful for my chart, do you offer such an option?</h3>
 <p></p>
Of course, you can make your chart show annotations at specified times. On the “Captions” tab, the second sheet of the data spreadsheet, you will find three columns. The first two columns are specifying the time contours that the annotation should be appearing into.<br>
In the first column you should spell out the time that the annotation should start appearing and in the second when it should stop showing. In column “C” you can insert the annotation itself. Then, head over to the “Captions” submenu on the right, make sure “Captions” from the drop-down menu is selected, and insert the column names into the relevant fields.</p>

  <br>
  <p><h3>I would like to change the order of the bars.</h3>
 <p></p>
Easy-peasy. Just head over to the “Controls” section on the Preview page, where you can enable the “show sort control” option. If you enable it, you will be able to change at will the order of the chart with two nice-looking buttons.</p>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p><h3>Is there an option that allows me to see the total/sum of the race?</h3>
 <p></p>
Yes, there is! You can easily enable the “Show Total” option on the “Total” section of the Preview page.</p>
<p>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p><h3>Can I set custom colours?</h3>
 <p></p>
Yes! There is not just one but two ways to go about it.<br>
· Go to preview and then to the “Colours” submenu. To change the colours, click on the “Palette” dropdown and choose the “Edit Palette” option, and then choose the colour you wish to edit. You can type the name of the colour you prefer or insert its HEX-code.<br>
· For a more granular approach, once more head over to the Preview page, then to the “Colours” submenu and locate the “Custom Overrides” box. You can assign a colour of your liking to every category. Type the entity whose colour you want to set followed by a colon and the colour’s name, its hex-code or rbg declaration. For example – Asia: #cc7722. Use multiple lines for multiple colours.<br>
For the moment, if your bars belong to different cetagories, you can only assign colours to categories and not to individual bars.

  <br>
  <p><h3>Can I edit my bar chart race after I have published it?</h3>
 <p></p>
Absolutely, fret not! Once you altered your graph in any way after you have published, the “publish” button will turn yellow. Once you are happy with the changes you have made to your graph, choose “republish”, take the new link and plug it in to your website or CMS.</p>
